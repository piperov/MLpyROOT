# MLpyROOT
An example of setting up a complex ML + pyROOT environment with conda and CMSSW

## How to try it
Start a Jupyter Hub session (e.g. on [Hammer](https://notebook.hammer.rcac.purdue.edu/)) and open a New -> Terminal
Then clone this repo: 
```git clone https://github.com/piperov/MLpyROOT
```
The end the terminal session by typing "exit", close the tab, and return to your directory tab.  There should be a new directory present called `MLpyROOT`, where you will find the notebooks for building the environment, and for running the example.
